# GGEMU-SHIPFAST

GGEMU-SHIPFAST is a high-quality game website template that makes it easy for anyone to launch and operate their own online gaming site.

The project is rebuilt with Tanstarter and designed for fast deployment, including one-click deployment on Cloudflare. It provides a ready-to-use foundation for building a game portal with online play, a shared game database, and monetization through advertising platforms.

## Deployment

GGEMU-SHIPFAST is designed to be deployed easily on Cloudflare. Choose the Cloudflare deployment flow for your environment, connect the repository, build the project, and publish the generated output.

## Monetization

After applying to and joining supported advertising platforms, site owners can place ads on their game website and earn advertising revenue from traffic.

## Site Configuration

Default site settings live in `siteconfig.js`. Runtime environment variables
with the same names take priority over `siteconfig.js`:

- `SITE_THEMES`
- `SITE_EMAIL`
- `SITE_NAME`
- `SITE_SLOGAN`
- `SITE_TEMPLATE`
- `GGEMU_REFCODE`
- `GOOGLE_ADSENSE_CLIENT`
- `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`

`SITE_TEMPLATE` accepts `default`, `two-column`, `poki-like`.

On Cloudflare Workers, configure these as Worker variables or secrets. The app
reads Cloudflare runtime bindings first, then falls back to `process.env`, then
to `siteconfig.js`.
